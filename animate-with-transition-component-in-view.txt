--- first we have transition component 



1)  single transition

1-we have this classes to animate

.enter-from {} 
.enter-to{} 
.enter-active {}

.leave-from {}
.leave-to {}
.leave-active {}


if i write name to transition

classes >>> .name-enter-from {} ...


2- we can replacing from and to , and write animation in the active
Example : .name-enter-active {
animation : name time s ..;
}

@keyframes name {
0% {}
50% {}
100% {}
} 



2) group transition
i replace parent with    transition-group component then i set tag='what it is' , note : tag='ul' 

then i write classes
.enter-from {}
.enter....


3) appear in transition group

when i render the page or refresh it my animation not working in the list , if i want it to working
i write appear in transiiotn group tag

4) .move  , also in transition group 

when i run animte on element add or remove , the elements doesn't animte to jump
if i want animte it also 
i use .name-move {
transition : }

note : if it doesn't work i should give position absolute to the child



5) i can use transition group in transition 

explain : if i transition ul and i want to transition something with ul 

i can use transition for both transition group and something else
and use classes with name for each transition


note : for doesn't oopsite i can use mode 
mode = 'out-in'
mode= 'in-out'


6) functions in the dom 
i have for each element functions call 
@before-enter   enter   after-enter 
before-leave    leave   after-leave

i can watch element animte in every mill seconds and controll it with function
i can pass el for each function , el is the element i animate it 

7) GSAP library 

i can replace this functions by using just 
gsap.set() in before enter 
& gsap.to() in enter
gsap.name(el,{
    duration : ,
    delay : ,
    y , x , opacit ...
    

})

and in gsap.to (el,{
    ...,
    onComplete : done,
})
i get done from params function

this done prevent after enter run in animate , and it is wait to finish my animate
